# Starcraft 2 Replay Parser #
This is a Starcraft 2 Replay (.SC2Replay) parser written in C++.<br />
We also have bindings for PHP and Python which means you can parse replays on any web site.<br />

## DEAD ##
This project is officially dead, if anyone wants to take up development again, contact me at zeta.two@gmail.com.

## NOTE ##

**PATCH 9:** Since patch 9 Blizzard changed the replay system completely. The parser does currently NOT work for replays from this patch and forward. We are working hard on solving this. Thank you for your support and patience.

Some progress has been made in the PHP part of the project making a complete PHP only port possible. This will take some time though. This essentially means that no matter what hosting enviroment you are in you will be able to use our lib.
